Vault-Alpha
===========

The original source code for my entry for Ludum Dare 25, Vault.
You can find an executable for this game at [my site.](http://www.zedutchgandalf.be/games/vault)
This source code is licensed under GPLv2. If you would decide to use (parts of) it in your own project, [I would love to hear about it!](mailto:contact@zedutchgandalf.be)
I put this here mainly for myself, as an easy, quick reference for the future. And for other people who would want to take a look at how I did something.
